# Full-Stack-Nanodegree
This repository contains my solutions to the projects of Udacity's Full Stack Web Developper Nanodegree.
I started the nanodegree on **19/01/2017** and completed the last project on **27/01/2017** (Almost 2 Weeks).

**UPDATE: On 30th Jan 2017 I officially got my certificate ðŸŽ‰.**
