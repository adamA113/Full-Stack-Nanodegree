## Neighborhood Map Project
This project is a part of Udacity's FS nanodegree program.

The app uses **Google maps API**, **Foursquare API**,**Bootstrap**
and **KnockoutJS** to fetch data about locations in Dubai 
and show them on the map.

The app is fully-reponsive, and filters down the locations on the
map as you type them, and grabs the locations from **Foursquare**.

## How to use it
You can use the app instantly by opening`index.html`.
